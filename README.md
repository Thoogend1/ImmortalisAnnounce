This is a complete rework of the ImmortalisAnnounce addon as originally made by Zelcandor, improved by Sherrim and later revitalised by Kabandhur.

The objective of the addon is to provide a non-config, no-nonsense addon that announced addons, whilst taking as little resources as possible.
There are a lot of mainstream Interrupt Announce addons on the market and I'm fairly confident most of them offer a lot more functionality and configuration options.
Elvui offers this functionality natively, for example.
If you don't already have a way to announce addons, but would like to have it with as little resources as possible (currently 4kbs of ram) this is the addon for you.
